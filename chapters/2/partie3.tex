\section{Conclution}
The case study, needs analysis, user identification, use cases, and user flows are all critical stages in the design and development of the LABES platform. The case study and needs analysis clearly identified the project's particular requirements. The identification of users, namely the roles of administrator and the subject manager,guaranteed that features were perfectly linked with each unit's expectations and duties. Use cases described the exact functions that users required to be able to do, whereas user flows depicted the user path to maximize the experience and reduce friction points. When these parts are combined cohesively, they result in a well-designed, intuitive platform capable of successfully reacting to users' operational and strategic requirements.
