\subsection{UX/UI}
Ensuring real-time data synchronization between controllers and the platform was a challenge due to network latency. This was addressed by optimizing MQTT communication and implementing efficient data caching strategies.

\subsection{Back-end}
Ensuring real-time data synchronization between controllers and the platform was a challenge due to network latency. This was addressed by optimizing MQTT communication and implementing efficient data caching strategies.


\subsection{Fronted}
Ensuring real-time data synchronization between controllers and the platform was a challenge due to network latency. This was addressed by optimizing MQTT communication and implementing efficient data caching strategies.
