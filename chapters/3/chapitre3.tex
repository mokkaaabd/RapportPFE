\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter describes the design and development of the LAB.E.S platform. \\
It emphasizes the strategic decisions and critical actions necessary to convert the laboratory's requirements into a functioning, high-performance platform.
First, the solution's overall layout is detailed, emphasizing its modular and scalable character, which allows harmonic integration of the various components while satisfying the criteria for flexibility and sustainability.
The chapter also describes the database structure, which was built to effectively manage data flows in real time while ensuring the consistency and security of the laboratory's important information.
On a technical level, it describes what steps were taken to construct the frontend and backend. The frontend, built on Figma's UX/UI models, provides an intuitive, high-performance user experience powered by current technologies such as React. Meanwhile, the backend relies on strong, secure services to ensure data processing and interchange across system components.\\
This introduction gives a basic overview which establishes the groundwork for the chapter, which delves into every technical and conceptual element needed in building a solution customized to the laboratory's unique requirements.
