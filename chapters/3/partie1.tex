\section{Project Architecture Design}

\subsection{System Overview}
The LAB.E.S platform was built using a multi-tier architecture to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The system is divided into three primary layers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend Layer}: Developed using ReactJS for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
    \item \textbf{Backend Layer}: Built with ASP.NET Core, providing RESTful APIs for communication with the frontend.
    \item \textbf{Data \& Communication Layer}: Handles real-time data exchange using MQTT and stores data in a relational database (SQL Server).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Microservices Approach}
A microservices architecture was adopted to decouple various system functionalities, allowing independent deployment and scaling of each component. This architecture ensures that the platform remains robust and adaptable as new features are added.
