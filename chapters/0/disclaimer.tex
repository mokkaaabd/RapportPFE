\chapter*{Disclaimer}
We regret to readers for the likely presence of French words in some of the diagrams, photos, and appendices in this research project. There are various explanations for this. To begin, the project's parent corporation is situated in France, and the early development team was primarily composed of French-speaking members. Second, while the project was intended to be worldwide in scope and implemented in all of the company's laboratories throughout the world, certain documents and graphics were created in a framework where French was the primary working language. Finally, changes in the development team throughout the course of the project resulted in contributions from a variety of persons, perhaps adding to the linguistic diversity.
While every attempt has been taken to unify material and guarantee general consistency, some graphic sections or appendices may nevertheless include French. We trust that these differences do not impede your general comprehension or the aim of this report, and we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.
