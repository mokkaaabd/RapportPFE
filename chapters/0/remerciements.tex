\chapter*{Remerciements}

   At this critical point in my career and training, I must take a minute to convey my thanks to everyone who has contributed to my experience at SOMFY, particularly at the SOMFY ZRIBA industrial site. This internship with this firm, the world leader in motion automation for home and building, has been an enriching and transformational experience thanks to the kind supervision of my supervisors.
First and foremost, I'd like to thank Maxime LORIN, Digital Engineering Manager, and Ludwig Taubert, full stack developer, for their great assistance and experience.
I also like to thank Khaled ABDELWAHER, the laboratory's manager, for his leadership and direction. Their advice and assistance have been invaluable to my professional progress, and I am really thankful for this chance.
I would also want to thank the whole SOMFY ZRIBA maintenance crew. The colleagues I had the pleasure of working with greeted me with compassion and professionalism, making the experience even more enjoyable.
Finally, I'd want to thank SOMFY ZRIBA's management for the opportunity to join a worldwide famous firm and contribute to its projects.
Overall, I would want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who contributed in any manner to this pivotal and formative experience at SOMFY ZRIBA.
