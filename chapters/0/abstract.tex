\chapter*{Abstract}
As part of Industry 4.0, digital transformation of industrial processes is critical for increasing operational efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability. This approach uses modern technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics to build intelligent, networked manufacturing systems. This method is consistent with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 9 (SDG 9), which aims to strengthen infrastructure, promote equitable and sustainable industrialization, and encourage innovation.The LAB.E.S project is entirely aligned with this dynamic, as it creates an innovative platform for real-time monitoring of laboratory operations. Although we did not work directly with artificial intelligence, our primary responsibility was to remove all paperwork in the lab and digitize all operations.
