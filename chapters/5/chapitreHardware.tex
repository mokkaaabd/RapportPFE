\chapter{Introduction}
As part of the LAB.E.S initiative, it became evident that the laboratory was experiencing a lack of communication. To address this issue, particular consideration was given to hardware design, which included the existing PLCs and their interactions. This section discusses the steps made to improve communication, the features of the available tools, and the changes needed to properly incorporate new functionalities and services.
